## üßÆ Calculation Methods

### Tax Calculation Process

#### 1. Income Aggregation
```
Total Income = Sum of Employment Income + ABN Income
```

#### 2. Deduction Calculation
```
Work From Home Deduction = Work From Home Hours √ó $0.67
Total Deductions = Work Related + Self Education + Donations + Other + WFH Deduction
```

#### 3. Taxable Income
```
Taxable Income = Max(0, Total Income - Total Deductions)
```

#### 4. Income Tax Calculation (2024-25 Tax Brackets)
- **$0 - $18,200**: 0% (Tax-free threshold)
- **$18,201 - $45,000**: 19%
- **$45,001 - $120,000**: 32.5%
- **$120,001 - $180,000**: 37%
- **$180,001+**: 45%

#### 5. Low Income Tax Offset (LITO)
- **Up to $37,500**: $700 offset
- **$37,501 - $45,000**: $700 - ((income - $37,500) √ó 5%)
- **$45,001 - $66,667**: $325 - ((income - $45,000) √ó 1.5%)
- **$66,668+**: No offset

#### 6. Medicare Levy
- **Rate**: 2% of taxable income
- **Base Threshold**: $27,222 (2024-25)
- **Family Threshold**: $45,907 + ($4,216 √ó dependents)
- **Phase-in**: Progressive application from threshold to threshold √ó 1.1
- **Exemptions**: Available for foreign residents and certain visa holders

#### 7. HECS-HELP Repayment
Progressive rates based on income:
- **$51,550 - $59,518**: 1%
- **$59,519 - $63,089**: 2%
- **$63,090 - $66,875**: 2.5%
- **$66,876 - $70,888**: 3%
- **$70,889 - $75,140**: 3.5%
- **$75,141 - $79,649**: 4%
- **$79,650 - $84,429**: 4.5%
- **$84,430 - $89,494**: 5%
- **$89,495 - $94,865**: 5.5%
- **$94,866 - $100,557**: 6%
- **$100,558 - $106,590**: 6.5%
- **$106,591 - $112,985**: 7%
- **$112,986 - $119,764**: 7.5%
- **$119,765 - $126,950**: 8%
- **$126,951 - $134,568**: 8.5%
- **$134,569 - $142,642**: 9%
- **$142,643 - $151,200**: 9.5%
- **$151,201+**: 10%

#### 8. Final Calculation
```
Final Tax = Income Tax - LITO + Medicare Levy + HECS Repayment
Tax Refund/Owing = Tax Withheld - Final Tax
```

### PAYG Estimation Algorithm

When tax withheld is unknown, the app estimates based on **TFN employment income only** (excludes ABN income):

- **Up to $18,200**: 0% withholding
- **$18,201 - $45,000**: 19% withholding
- **$45,001 - $120,000**: 32.5% withholding (on amount over $45,000)
- **$120,001 - $180,000**: 37% withholding (on amount over $120,000)
- **$180,001+**: 45% withholding (on amount over $180,000)

Plus estimated Medicare levy (2% for TFN income over $23,226).

**Important**: ABN/business income is excluded from PAYG estimation as employers don't withhold tax from business income.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Accuracy and Limitations

- **Estimates Only**: Results are estimates and should not replace professional tax advice
- **2024-25 Rates**: Uses current Australian tax rates and thresholds
- **Simplified Calculations**: Some complex scenarios may require professional consultation
- **ATO Compliance**: Calculations follow ATO guidelines but may not cover all edge cases

### Data Privacy

- **No Data Storage**: All calculations performed locally on device
- **No Network Requests**: App works completely offline
- **No Personal Data Collection**: No user information is transmitted or stored

### Professional Advice

Users should consult qualified tax professionals for:

- Complex investment scenarios
- Business tax obligations
- Capital gains calculations
- International tax implications
- Official tax return lodgment
