## 🧮 Calculation Methods

### Tax Calculation Process

#### 1. Income Aggregation

```
Total Income = Sum of Employment Income + ABN Income
```

#### 2. Deduction Calculation

```
Work From Home Deduction = Work From Home Hours × $0.70
Total Deductions = Work Related + Self Education + Donations + Other + WFH Deduction
```

#### 3. Taxable Income

```
Taxable Income = Max(0, Total Income - Total Deductions)
```

#### 4. Income Tax Calculation (2025-26 Tax Brackets)

- **$0 - $18,200**: 0% (Tax-free threshold)
- **$18,201 - $45,000**: 16%
- **$45,001 - $135,000**: 30%
- **$135,001 - $190,000**: 37%
- **$190,001+**: 45%

#### 5. Low Income Tax Offset (LITO)

- **Up to $37,500**: $700 offset
- **$37,501 - $45,000**: $700 - ((income - $37,500) × 5%)
- **$45,001 - $66,667**: $325 - ((income - $45,000) × 1.5%)
- **$66,668+**: No offset

#### 6. Medicare Levy

- **Rate**: 2% of taxable income
- **Base Threshold**: $27,222 (2024-25 threshold applies to later years until replaced)
- **Family Threshold**: $45,907 + ($4,216 × dependents)
- **Phase-in**: 10c for each $1 above the relevant low-income threshold, capped at 2% of taxable income
- **Exemptions**: Available for foreign residents and certain visa holders

#### 7. HECS-HELP Repayment

From 2025-26, compulsory repayments use marginal rates:

- **$0 - $67,000**: Nil
- **$67,001 - $125,000**: 15c for each $1 over $67,000
- **$125,001 - $179,285**: $8,700 plus 17c for each $1 over $125,000
- **$179,286+**: 10% of total repayment income

#### 8. Final Calculation

```
Final Tax = Income Tax - LITO + Medicare Levy + HECS Repayment
Tax Refund/Owing = Tax Withheld - Final Tax
```

### PAYG Estimation Algorithm

When tax withheld is unknown, the app estimates based on **TFN employment income only** (excludes ABN income):

- **Up to $18,200**: 0% withholding
- **$18,201 - $45,000**: 16% withholding
- **$45,001 - $135,000**: 30% withholding (on amount over $45,000)
- **$135,001 - $190,000**: 37% withholding (on amount over $135,000)
- **$190,001+**: 45% withholding (on amount over $190,000)

Plus estimated Medicare levy (2% for TFN income over $27,222).

**Important**: ABN/business income is excluded from PAYG estimation as employers don't withhold tax from business income.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Accuracy and Limitations

- **Estimates Only**: Results are estimates and should not replace advice from a registered tax agent
- **2025-26 Rates**: Uses current Australian tax rates and thresholds
- **Simplified Calculations**: Some complex scenarios may require professional consultation
- **ATO Source Notes**: Supported tax-year assumptions are source-linked but may not cover all edge cases

### Data Privacy

- **Local Saved Data**: Saved calculations are stored locally on the device
- **Optional Diagnostics**: Preview and production builds can enable analytics or crash reporting through environment configuration
- **Export Control**: Reports leave the device only when the user chooses to export or share them

### Professional Advice

Users should consult qualified tax professionals for:

- Complex investment scenarios
- Business tax obligations
- Capital gains calculations
- International tax implications
- Official tax return lodgment

## 📄 License

This project is for educational and estimation purposes only. Users should consult a registered tax agent or official ATO services for actual tax return preparation.
